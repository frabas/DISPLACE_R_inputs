Please have a look at the Wiki page for some help in understanding the parameterisation steps 
using the R routines. All the R routines are there to generate the various DISPLACE input files (basically a suite of txt files). 
Some of the routines could also be directly called within the DISPLACE user interface 
(work in progress). Some raw data, input of these routines, are given as illustration so that the routines should be ready to work.
