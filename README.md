## Follow the steps


Please have a look at the Wiki page for some help in understanding the parameterisation steps 
using the R routines. All the R routines are there to generate the various DISPLACE input files (basically a suite of txt files). 
Most of the routines could also be directly called within the DISPLACE user interface (Parameters>Objects Editor in the main menu).
Some raw data, input of these routines, are given as illustration in the public repository DISPLACE_input_gis\testexample
so that the routines should be ready to work.

## Step 0: DISPLACE graph

## Step 1: fish populations

# Specification 1: stock numbers and biological traits

# Specification 2: spatial layers

## Step 2: fish populations

# Specification 1: vessel features

# Specification 2: spatial layers

## Step 3: fishing metiers

# Specification 1: gear type selectivity

etc.
