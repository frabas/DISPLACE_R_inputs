Follow the steps...

Note that the step 0 makes use of the VMStools methodology to merge VMS data to logbooks 
(However the VMStools library is not directly used as the used functions are attached here.)

These routines are just given as illustration for the time being 
because not perfectly generic i.e. 
these routines would need some rewritting to fit particular case studies in some cases

Would also need some extra GIS shape files for some cases.
