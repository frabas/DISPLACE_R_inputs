Follow the steps...(look at the scheme in critical_path.png)

Note that the first steps makes use of the VMStools methodology to merge VMS data to logbooks 
(However the VMStools library is not directly used as the used functions are attached here.)

These routines are just given as illustration for the time being 
because still some corners that are not perfectly generic,  meaning that 
these routines would need some rewritting to fit particular case studies in some cases

Would also need some extra existing GIS shape files for some cases and/or handmade GIS files

Note that some steps can actually be done directly WITHIN the UI (for example the graph creation), and
all the R routines should ultimately be replaced by equivalent operations within the UI.
